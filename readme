UEFI Boot - is s small project aimed to organize the loading of linux (ubuntu) via UEFI firmware (without any bootloader).

On this stage it works only with Ubuntu 15.04 and higher (as it requires systemd)

All files are located in folders as they should be copied during installation (installation is still manual process)

Setup script is designed to work on Ubuntu system that is installed with UEFI support (grub-efi is in use instead of grub-pc). It performs preinstallation actions and activates systemd service.
setup.sh assumes that EFS partition is /dev/sda1. If it not rigtht assumption change mount comand in line #4. 

One additional setup step should be performed manualy: you should change one line in your /etc/fstab: 
1. just open /etc/fstab in any text editor with roor privileges
2. find a line that looks like
UUID=5C05-A2AC	/boot/efi	vfat	umask=0077  0	1
3. change it to something like
UUID=5C05-A2AC  /boot       vfat    umask=0077      0       1
