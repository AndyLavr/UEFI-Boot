UEFI Boot - is s small project aimed to organize the loading of linux (ubuntu) via UEFI firmware (without any bootloader).

On this stage it works only with Ubuntu 15.04 and higher (as it requires systemd)

All files are located in folders as they should be copied during installation (installation is a part of setup.sh scrip)

Files:
readme - thi file
license - GPL license
setup.sh - setup and initialization script
/usr/bin/uefuboot-update - utility to update UEFI boot options according to installed kernel wersions
/etc/uefiboot.cfg - configuration file of uefuboot-update utility
/etc/systemd/system/uefiboot-update.path - systemd file watcher unit
/etc/systemd/system/uefiboot-update.service - systemd service unit

Setup script is designed to work on Ubuntu system that is installed with UEFI support (grub-efi is in use instead of grub-pc). It performs preinstallation actions and activates systemd service.
